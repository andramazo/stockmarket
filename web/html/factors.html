Market cap
It is a very big mistake when you try to guess a company’s worth from the price of a stock. You should know that the more important is the market capitalization of the particular company. This helps to determine the worth of a company. So market cap serves as an important use to determine share prices.

Earning per share
Now when it comes to the term, “earning per share”, it means the profit that a particular company has made per share and that too on the last quarter. If you need to know the health of the company then this is the most important factor. What’s more earning per share also influences the buying tendency in the market that results in the increase of the particular stock price. This is the reason why it is very important for every public company to bring out the quarterly report. So when you wish to make a profitable investment, then the best thing for you would be to keep a good watch on the quarterly reports of different companies. This is very important before you wish to invest your hard earned money in the share market.

Impact of news
News is another factor that affects the share price. When there is positive news about a particular stock or company, people try to invest all their money in that particular stock or market.
