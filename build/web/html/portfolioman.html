Portfolio Management Service


Portfolio Management is an art and science of making decisions about investment mix and policy, matching investments to objectives, asset allocation for individuals and institutions, and balancing risk against performance.

Portfolio management is all about strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the choice of debt vs. equity, domestic vs. international, growth vs. safety, and many other tradeoffs encountered in the attempt to maximize return at a given appetite for risk.

In today's complex financial environment, investors have unique needs which are derived from their risk appetite and financial goals. But regardless of this, every investor seeks to maximize his returns on investments without capital erosion. While there are many investment avenues such as fixed deposits, income funds, bonds, equities etc. It is a proven fact that Equities as an asset class typically tend to outperform all other asset classes over the long run.
