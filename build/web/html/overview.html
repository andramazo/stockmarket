India Market Overview

from the Department of Commerce 

The Indian market, and its one billion plus population, presents lucrative and diverse opportunities for U.S. exporters with the right products, services, and commitment. In recent times, the declining value of the dollar, vis-ˆ-vis competitors' currencies, is expanding and accelerating these opportunities. India's infrastructure, transportation, energy, environmental, health care, high-tech, and defense sector requirements for equipment and services will exceed tens of billions of dollars in the mid-term as the Indian economy globalizes and expands. India's GDP, currently growing at around 7 percent, makes it one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Construction of nearly everything from airports to container ports to teleports, is setting the stage to remake India.

Doing Business in India

The Indo-U.S. relationship is in the midst of a remarkable transformation. The two countries, politically and economically distant for much of the late twentieth century, now find their national interests converging at many points. Indian tariffs have been reduced progressively since the early 1990's. Tariffs and poor infrastructure present the biggest obstacles to foreign investment and growth, but India's infrastructure requirements also present trade and investment opportunities for American companies. Key factors to doing business successfully in India include: finding good partners who have knowledge of the local market and procedural issues; good planning; aggressive due diligence and follow up; and patience and commitment.

Finding partners and agents. New business must address issues of sales channels, distribution and marketing practices, pricing and labeling and protection of intellectual property. Relationships and personal meetings with the potential agents are extremely important. Due diligence is strongly recommended.
Geographic diversity. U.S. companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, should consider approaching India's market on a local level. Good localized information is a key to success in such a large and diverse country. U.S. Commercial Service posts in New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Calcutta provide indispensable local information and advice and are well plugged in with local business and economic leaders. Often multiple agents are required to serve each geographic market in the country.
Market entry options. Options include using a subsidiary relationship, a joint venture with an Indian partner, or using a liaison, project, or branch office.
